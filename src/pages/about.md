Minimal space for things i am/have worked on. I'm a staff developer focusing mainly on the frontend right now. I've developed embedded systems as well as frontend. I started web development back in the mid 90's in middleschool. The amount of changes ive seen feels insane. from no style sheets (think writing a site styled... without CSS) to frameworks like jquery and angular. Currently working in React, and playing with Qwik/Astro.
