So I keep trying to start a blog. but it is hard. as a web developer. I keep wanting to _super_ customise it. And that is great... when needed.

But this is a blog. I want it light, and I dont want to work on making the whole site for months before actually being able to post up to it.

### Astro

So I recently tried astro, I don't think it is the end all be all for all sites. however it is quite nice and powerful.
